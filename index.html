      <h1>HTML For Beginners The Easy Way: Start Learning HTML</h1>
      <h2>HTML for Absolute Beginners</h2>

      <p>
        While many guides on the internet attempt to teach HTML using a lot of
        mind-boggling theory, this tutorial will instead focus on giving you the
        practical skills to build your first site. <br />
        <p>The aim is to show you ‘how’ to create your first web page without
        spending the entire tutorial focusing too much on the “why.” By the end
        of this tutorial, you will have the know-how to create a basic website
        and we hope that this will inspire you to delve further into the world
        of HTML using our follow-on guides.</p>
      </p>

      <p>HTML is used to create electronic documents (called pages) that are displayed on the World Wide Web. Each page contains a series of connections to other pages called hyperlinks. Every web page you see was written using one version of HTML. HTML code ensures the proper formatting of text and images for your Internet browser. Without HTML, a browser would not know how to display text as elements or load images or other elements. HTML also provides a basic structure of the page, upon which Cascading Style Sheets are overlaid to change its appearance. One could think of HTML as the bones (structure) of a web page, and CSS as its skin (appearance).</p>

      <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
      <p>Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know what you are writing. <strong> HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.</strong>
        <p> The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.</p>

      <h2>The History of HTML</h2>
      <img src="images/dollars.jpg">
      <p>HTML was first created by Tim Berners-Lee, Robert Cailliau, and others starting in 1989. It stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. <strong> Hypertext means that the document contains links that allow the reader to jump to other places in the document or to another document altogether.</strong> The latest version is known as HTML5.
      <p>A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each other to control how text is processed and presented. To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.</p>
